# 🗂️💬 Chat with Tabs

A browser extension for any **Chromium-based browser** (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.) that lets you **chat with your open browser tabs**. Select a couple of pages, hit **Use as context** and watch them appear inside ChatGPT (or Gemini) as handy Markdown attachments. Perfect for asking things like:

- "Summarise these docs"
- "Compare these products"
- "Explain this blog post like I'm 5"

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 Lists every open tab in the current window (excluding the active one – because ChatGPT is probably there!).
- 😴 Detects and marks sleeping/discarded tabs so you know they might take a moment to wake up.
- ✔️ Multi-select via friendly checkboxes.
- 🚀 Converts each selected page to **clean Markdown** thanks to [Turndown](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown) with GFM support.
- 📎 Seamlessly pastes the Markdown into ChatGPT/Gemini as **file attachments** using a synthetic clipboard event – no manual copy-paste required.
- ⏳ Inline loading indicator and timeout handling, so you’re never left wondering.
- 🛡️ Everything happens locally – no data is sent anywhere except to the AI tab you choose.
